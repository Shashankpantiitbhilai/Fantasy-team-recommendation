# SquadCraft AI

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered Fantasy Cricket Team Recommender for Dream11, which helps users build optimal fantasy cricket teams based on historical data, player performance predictions, and match-specific contextual factors. The tool leverages machine learning techniques, such as GRU-based models, to predict player performance and generate teams with high chances of success in upcoming fantasy sports games.

### Key Features:
- **Predictive Machine Learning Model:** GRU-based model to forecast player performance for upcoming matches.
- **Interactive UI:** Python-based user interface with two interactive modes (Product UI and Model UI) that include real-time team-building guidance.
- **Explainable AI:** The tool provides explainability of the model's predictions to help users understand the rationale behind team recommendations.
- **Generative AI Integration:** Interactive audio and video descriptions for real-time insights and explanations.

## Problem Statement

The primary goal of the project is to build a solution that:
1. **Assists users in creating optimal fantasy teams** by leveraging player data and predicting their performance.
2. **Includes an intuitive UI** that provides real-time guidance on player selection and team composition.
3. **Ensures explainability** for the user to understand the rationale behind each recommendation, boosting their confidence in the system.

The project focuses specifically on cricket and aims to address the following:
- Predict player performance based on historical and contextual data.
- Provide an explainable and user-friendly interface that simplifies team creation for Dream11 users.

## Inputs and Constraints

### Inputs:
1. **Team Names**: Provide the exact names of the two teams from the upcoming match.
2. **Match Date**: The date of the upcoming match (after July 1, 2024).
3. **Training Period**: No data after June 30, 2024, should be used to train the model.

Example input:
- Team 1: Colombo Strikers
- Team 2: Kandy Falcons
- Match Date: 2024-07-18

### Constraints:
- The team must consist of exactly 11 players, with the composition adhering to the following rules:
  - **Batsmen:** [x] players
  - **Bowlers:** [x] players
  - **All-rounders:** [x] players
  - **Wicketkeepers:** [x] players

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) for performance prediction.
- **Frameworks**: 
  - **React** (Frontend UI)
  - **Express.js** (Backend)
  - **Flask** (Python web framework for the model)
- **Libraries**:
  - **TensorFlow** (for building the machine learning model)
  - **NumPy**, **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
  - **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for data visualization)
  - **JavaScript** (for frontend interactions)
  - **HTML**, **CSS** (for styling)
- **Generative AI**: Interactive audio/video descriptions for real-time guidance.

## Expected Output

The output should include two key interfaces:
1. **Product UI**: 
   - Provides users with an interactive experience to select the best team of 11 players.
   - Recommendations are explainable, with visual explanations that enhance user confidence.
   
2. **Model UI**:
   - Allows evaluation and testing of the machine learning model with the user inputs.
   - Provides performance metrics and insights into how the model makes predictions.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm (for frontend and backend)
- TensorFlow, Flask, React.js, and other required libraries.

### Steps to Run the Project:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shashankpantiitbhilai/Fantasy-team-recommendation.git
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the backend server (Flask):**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Start the frontend server (React):**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

6. Open the app in your browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## How to Use

1. **Enter the details of the teams** (Team names, Match date, etc.) in the Product UI.
2. **Get team recommendations** generated by the predictive model.
3. **Interact with the AI-powered voice and visual descriptions** for real-time insights on player selection.

## Future Improvements

- **Expand the model to include additional sports** and data sources.
- **Enhance user experience** with more interactive features like live team tracking and updates during the game.
- **Incorporate advanced ML techniques** for even more accurate predictions.
